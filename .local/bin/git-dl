# git-dl
#
# The most efficient way (that I found) to download a given revision
# from a git repository, and only this.
#
# Usage is git-dl REMOTE REV DEST-DIR
#
# - REMOTE-URL is a git URL, either remote or local.
#
# - REV is an commit-ish object that can be checked out (may work with
#   just tree-ish)
#
# - DEST is an empty or non-existing dir where REF will be checked out.
#
# The output of this command in DEST is NOT a repository, it's an
# orphan worktree.  The git-dir is created and deleted automatically.
#
# Technically, this should download exactly n+2 objects, where n is
# the number of files in REV's tree.
